# burgerApp
## Introduction
With this app we were tasked with completing a fullstack web pplication that stored user input into a database with MYSEQL. I was able to succefully link all required task with the new found knowldege of CRUD commans that allows one to interact with the database.
## problems
As usual ran into minor problem but was able to overcome the majority of them.
some minor problems i faced was getting my devoured burgers and burgers that are cooling down to be side by side, i entered containers, rows, and then colums to the code bu that didnt seem to help it. As for my delet button it may seem broken but when you press the trash it button you must refresh the page for the burger to delted from the page and database.
